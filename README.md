# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview of Analysis:
In this project, we had access to approximately 50 datasets. I choose amazon reviews for kitchen products.
The analysis used PySpark to perform ETL process to extract the dataset, transform the data, connect to an AWS RDS instance, load the transformed data into pgAdmin. Also, PySpark was used to determine if there is any bias toward favorable reviwes from Vine members in the dataset.

## Deliverables:
- Deliverable 1: Perform ETL on Amazon Product Reviews
- Deliverable 2: Determine Bias of Vine Reviews
- Deliverable 3: A Written Report on the Analysis (README.md)
